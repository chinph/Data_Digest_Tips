I'm building this page as a space to share helpful analytical tips, tools, and techniques I’ve picked up (and am still discovering) on my journey to becoming a better analyst. Whether you're just starting out or looking to sharpen your skills, I hope these insights make your data work a little easier — and maybe even a bit more fun.
